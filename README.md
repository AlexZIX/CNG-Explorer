# CNG Explorer
Explorer for Cryptography API: Next Generation

Windows have the powerful Cryptography API which supports encryption, hashing and signing using modern algorithms. CNG is designed to be extensible at many levels and cryptography agnostic in behavior. It provides access to the different crypto and storage providers which supports different kinds of equipment include smart cards and TPM 2.0 modules.
CNG Explorer is a tool which helps developers to explore CNG API, understand how it works and how to use it in their applications.

CNG Explorer developed in Embarcadero Delphi 11 Alexandia and contains ncrypt.h headers ported from C++ to Delphi by me.

Also it contains BCHexEditor for Delphi by zhugecaomao - https://github.com/zhugecaomao/BCHexEditor
